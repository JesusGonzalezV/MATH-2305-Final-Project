# MATH-2305-Final-Project

# MST Python Package
This is a group python project for MATH_2305 that solves the minimum weight spanning tree problem. We have written python code that implements Prim's Algorithm from scratch.

# NOTE: This program can be executed on any Operating System as long its ran on Python 3.0 or above and it does not need any additional changes by the User.

# Graph Theory

A graph is an ordered pair G = (V,E) consisting of a nonempty set vertices (V) and a set edges (E) of two-element subsets of V.

# Prim's Algorithm

Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.

# Instructions to Execute

The "main.py" function is where the user has to run the program from which then the program will ask the user to input the starting node. After the user has successfully executed the program it will provide the plots and the total cost of the tree. 

If you want to change the file go back to the "main.py" and change the name manually from the "graph_data". Note that the file must be in the "test-graphs" folder before executing. 

You have 3 graphs to choose from:   
-G1  
-G2  
-G3
